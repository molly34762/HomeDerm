_**The first digital dermatology solution designed for older adults**_

## Introduction

HomeDerm is an easy-to-use, engaging, digital interface tailored to unique needs of older adults that allows them to share data, including skin images and an analytics platform that synthesizes information for care teams and enables real-time monitoring and accurate, timely decisions. 

HomeDerm bridges the digital divide in geriatric tele-dermatology for older adults, facilitating safe and convenient clinical management of dermatological conditions from the comfort of their home or care facility.	

HomeDerm helps reduce unnecessary visits and procedures, while ensuring prompt, high-quality care for patients who need it.

## Need statement

There is a need to create a senior-friendly form of communication between adults > 65 years old and dermatologists to provide timely and effective diagnosis and treatment of skin disease, while reducing unnecessary in-person visits.

## Prototypes

### Mobile Application for the Elderly

The patient/caregiver can download the HomeDerm mobile application through a link their providers have sent to them. The patient/caregiver will then take photos of a concerning lesion. These pictures are uploaded to the HomeDerm's Web Application dashboard for clinicians to review.

### Web Application for Providers

Clinicians can monitor their patients' photographs and health conditions asynchronously. The HomeDerm Web Application organizes all of the patients' pictures by the patient name, triage, and type of skin lesion. By displaying patients' pictures in a table format, clinicians can quickly address urgent health conditions. The clinician can send their recommendation back to the patient/caregiver.
